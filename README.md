# Java-Sample-Twitter

> Current State: Planing

This project is used to practise my Java skill.

As a beginner for developing Java project, I want to pratise knwoledge I have learned with developing a project.

I will develop a mini Twitter project in this repository.

It will contain following functions:

- [ ] User - Register, Login, Logout, Retrieve Info, Delete Acount
- [ ] Relationship - Follow, Unfollow, Followers and Followings
- [ ] Tweet - Publish, Retieve, Timeline, Like, Comment, Retweet


Though it just is a mini Tweet, I still want to it can support very many users, so I will use a metrics tool to mock users. And this project will use micro-service techonic.

For practising Spring Framework and Spring Boot, the user module will be built with Spring framework in the `user` branch. The other modules will be built with Spring Boot and in respective branch.

## Tech Stack
- Spring Framework
- Spring Boot
- Spring Cloud
- Mysql
- Redis
- kafka

## Frontend

I have knwon a lot about `React` framework, so after build the backend, maybe I will build the website for this project.
